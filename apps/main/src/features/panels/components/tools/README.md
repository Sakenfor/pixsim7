# Tool & Utility Panels

Generic utility and tool panels that aren't domain-specific.

## Panels in this directory

- **ExportImportPanel** - Export and import simulation data, settings, etc.
- **ValidationPanel** - Validation and error checking utilities

## Guidelines

Add panels here if they are:
- Utility or tool-focused (not part of a specific domain)
- Generic settings or configuration panels
- Export/import functionality
- Validation or checking tools

If a panel is domain-specific (scene, game, gallery, etc.), place it in the domain's `panels/` subdirectory instead.
