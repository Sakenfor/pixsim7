# Old Status Reports

This directory contains **historical status reports and summaries** that documented completed work.

## Purpose

These documents served their purpose during active development but are now superseded by:
- Canonical system docs (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `GAMEPLAY_SYSTEMS.md`)
- Architecture Decision Records (`docs/decisions/*.md`)
- Service/component references (`docs/backend/SERVICES.md`, `docs/frontend/COMPONENTS.md`)

## Why Archived (Not Deleted)

These documents preserve historical context:
- Design decisions made at the time
- Migration paths taken
- Problems encountered and solved
- References for understanding git history
