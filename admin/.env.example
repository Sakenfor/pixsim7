# Admin Panel Environment Configuration

# Backend base URL (FastAPI) - root, not including /api/v1
# Previously VITE_API_URL included /api/v1; we now use VITE_BACKEND_URL + relative paths
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001

# For ZeroTier network access:
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://10.243.48.125:8001

# Notes:
VITE_ADMIN_PORT=8002

# Notes:
# - Vite env vars must start with VITE_ prefix
# - Restart dev server after changing this file (npm run dev)
# - For production, set these in your deployment environment
# - API helper builds URLs like `${VITE_BACKEND_URL}/api/v1/...`
