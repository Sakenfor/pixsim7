label: "PixSim7 Core Prompt Ontology"
description: >
  Core semantic vocabulary for describing visual/narrative prompts in PixSim7.
  This defines stable IDs for entities, actions, states, spatial relations,
  camera concepts, and beats. Parser, ActionBlocks, graphs, and game systems
  should normalize to these IDs rather than inventing new ad-hoc labels.

entities:
  character:
    kinds:
      primary:
        id: "character.primary"
        label: "Primary character"
        description: "POV / focal character (she/her in most prompts)."
        properties: ["pose", "emotional_state", "body_language", "breathing"]
      secondary:
        id: "character.secondary"
        label: "Secondary / creature"
        description: "Non-POV entities (minotaur, werewolf, partner, etc.)."
