**Task: Gallery Provider Status & Flags (Local vs Provider vs Flagged)**

> **For Agents (How to use this file)**
> - This task improves the **Assets/Gallery UI** so it reflects whether an asset:
>   - Was accepted by the provider (Pixverse/OpenAPI),
>   - Was saved locally but provider upload failed,
>   - Or has been flagged / rejected after upload (if available).
> - Use it when you:
>   - Touch asset list APIs or gallery UI.
>   - Work on upload flows (extension, gallery tools).
> - Read these first for context:
>   - `GAMEPLAY_SYSTEMS.md` – asset/quest/inventory conventions
>   - `pixsim7/backend/main/api/v1/assets.py` – asset list & upload endpoints
>   - `pixsim7/backend/main/services/upload/upload_service.py` – provider upload behavior and notes
>   - `apps/main/src/routes/Assets.tsx` – main gallery route
>   - `apps/main/src/components/media/MediaCard.tsx` – asset card UI

## Context

Currently:

- The Chrome extension badge and some UI surfaces **assumed** that “upload accepted by PixSim7” meant “uploaded to Pixverse/OpenAPI successfully.”
- The backend actually distinguishes:
  - Provider success vs local-only save via `UploadAssetResponse.note`:
    - `"Uploaded to provider successfully"`
    - `"Asset saved locally; provider upload failed: ..."`
- The extension has been updated to use this and now shows:
  - `saved to PixSim7; provider upload failed` when provider upload fails.
- The main gallery UI, however, still only shows provider id (e.g. `pixverse`) and generic status, not whether the provider actually accepted or later flagged the asset.

We want the **Assets/Gallery** view to show a truthful, at-a-glance view of provider status so users are not misled about where media actually lives.

---

## Phase 32.1 – Expose Provider Upload Status on Asset DTO

**Goal**  
Make backend asset list responses carry a simple, stable provider status that the frontend can render.

**Scope**

- Backend asset API:
  - `pixsim7/backend/main/api/v1/assets.py`
- Asset schema:
  - `pixsim7/backend/main/shared/schemas/asset_schemas.py` (or equivalent)

**Key Steps**

1. Add a derived field to the asset response model, e.g.:
   - `provider_status: "ok" | "local_only" | "unknown"` (or similar).
2. Derive it from existing fields:
   - If `asset.provider_asset_id` is present and last upload note did not indicate failure → `"ok"`.
   - If `provider_asset_id` is null but asset exists and note starts with `"Asset saved locally; provider upload failed"` → `"local_only"`.
   - Otherwise → `"unknown"` (or omitted).
3. Make sure `/api/v1/assets` responses include this field for each asset.

**Status:** `[X]` ✅ Complete

**Implementation Details:**
- Backend: `pixsim7/backend/main/api/v1/assets.py` lines 78-100, 135-150
- Schema: `pixsim7/backend/main/shared/schemas/asset_schemas.py` line 58
- provider_status field returns: "ok", "local_only", "unknown", "flagged"
- Computed based on provider_asset_id and provider_flagged fields
- Works in both list and get asset endpoints

## Phase 32.2 – Add Provider Status Badges in Gallery

**Goal**  
Visually differentiate local-only assets vs provider-accepted assets in the gallery UI.

**Scope**

- Gallery route and components:
  - `apps/main/src/routes/Assets.tsx`
  - `apps/main/src/components/media/MediaCard.tsx`

**Key Steps**

1. Thread the new `provider_status` field through:
   - From `/api/v1/assets` hook (`useAssets`) into `AssetsRoute`.
   - From `AssetsRoute` into `MediaCard` props.
2. In `MediaCard`, add a small badge or icon:
   - For `"ok"`: e.g. `Provider OK` or a green check.
   - For `"local_only"`: e.g. `Local only` or a warning badge (tooltip: “Provider upload failed; stored locally in PixSim7”).
   - For `"unknown"`: no extra badge, or a neutral icon.
3. Keep the design minimal but clear; avoid cluttering the card:
   - Use existing `Badge` / `StatusBadge` components where possible.
   - Prefer short labels and tooltips over long inline text.

**Status:** `[X]` ✅ Complete

**Implementation Details:**
- Component: `apps/main/src/components/media/MediaCard.tsx`
- Badges shown on hover (lines 210-224):
  - "Provider OK" (green) - when provider_status === 'ok'
  - "Local only" (yellow) - when provider_status === 'local_only'
  - "Flagged" (red) - when provider_status === 'flagged'
- Clear tooltips explaining each status
- Integrated with existing hover overlay design

## Phase 32.3 – Optional: Flagged / Moderation Status Surfacing

**Goal**  
If the provider later flags or rejects assets (moderation, policy), surface that clearly in the gallery.

**Scope**

- Backend:
  - Any job/status tables where provider moderation/flag status is recorded.
- Frontend:
  - Same gallery components as Phase 32.2.

**Key Steps**

1. Identify where provider “flagged” status is stored (jobs, provider metadata, or asset fields).
2. Expose a simple flag on asset responses, e.g. `provider_flagged: bool` and optional `provider_flag_reason`.
3. Add a distinct badge in the gallery:
   - E.g. `Flagged` (red), with tooltip showing the reason if available.
4. Ensure that this badge is visually distinct from “local only” vs “ok” so users can understand:
   - “Local only” = PixSim7 kept the file, provider never accepted it.
   - “Flagged” = provider accepted but later marked it as problematic.

**Status:** `[ ]` Optional - Backend Ready

**Implementation Details:**
- Backend has `provider_flagged` field in Asset model and AssetResponse schema
- Backend has `provider_flag_reason` field for detailed moderation messages
- ✅ Field is exposed in API responses
- ❌ No webhook/polling system to populate these fields from provider APIs yet
- Frontend displays "Flagged" badge when field is true (ready to use)

**Next Steps if Implementing:**
1. Add provider moderation webhook endpoints
2. Implement polling/webhook handling for Pixverse/OpenAPI moderation status
3. Update provider_flagged and provider_flag_reason when moderation occurs

---

## Phase 32.4 – Filters & Quick-View for Provider Status

**Goal**  
Make it easy to quickly see and filter assets by provider status (e.g. “show me all local-only assets”).

**Scope**

- Asset filters and gallery toolbar:
  - `apps/main/src/hooks/useAssets.ts`
  - `apps/main/src/routes/Assets.tsx`

**Key Steps**

1. Introduce an optional filter for provider status in the hook/filter model, e.g.:
   - `provider_status?: 'ok' | 'local_only' | 'flagged'` (or similar).
2. Thread this through:
   - URL/query parameters → `AssetFilters` → `useAssets` → backend `GET /assets` (if/when backend supports filtering by provider status).
3. As a first step, if backend filtering is not yet implemented:
   - Allow frontend-side quick filter buttons (e.g. small pills in the Assets view) that just visually highlight or group assets by status.
4. Add a simple “Status overview” helper in the toolbar, e.g.:
   - `X Provider OK / Y Local-only / Z Flagged`, computed from the current page of assets.

**Status:** `[X]` ✅ Complete

**Implementation Details:**
- Route: `apps/main/src/routes/Assets.tsx`
- Status overview (lines 254-270):
  - Shows count of assets by status: "X OK / Y Local / Z Flagged"
  - Computed from items.filter() in real-time
- Filter dropdown (lines 299-309):
  - "All Status", "Provider OK", "Local Only", "Flagged", "Unknown"
  - Syncs to URL query params and sessionStorage
  - Updates via setAndPersist() helper
- ✅ Frontend filtering works
- ⚠️ Backend doesn't filter by provider_status in SQL yet (filters client-side)

**Next Steps if Optimizing:**
1. Add provider_status filter support in backend asset service
2. Push filtering into SQL query instead of post-query filtering

## Phase 32.5 – Align Gallery Upload Controls with Extension Semantics

**Goal**  
Ensure upload controls in the gallery (e.g. `MediaCard` upload button, gallery tools) use the same semantics and messaging as the Chrome extension (local vs provider success).

**Scope**

- Gallery upload controls:
  - `apps/main/src/components/media/MediaCard.tsx`
  - Any gallery tools that trigger uploads (e.g. re-upload, cross-provider copy)

**Key Steps**

1. Review `MediaCard`’s upload button behavior:
   - It currently treats `ok: boolean` from `onUploadClick` as “success” and shows generic “Uploaded (accepted)” in the tooltip.
2. Update upload flows used in gallery to distinguish:
   - **Local-only** vs **provider-accepted**, similar to how the extension now uses `providerSucceeded` and `note` from `UploadAssetResponse`.
3. Adjust `MediaCard` tooltip text and internal state so that:
   - “success” corresponds to provider-accepted or explicit “saved and provider OK” semantics.
   - When only a local save is possible, the tooltip and icon reflect that (e.g. “Saved locally; provider upload failed”). This should match the gallery badges from Phase 32.2.
4. Keep the user experience consistent with the Chrome extension messaging so users see the same interpretation of “success” in both places.

**Status:** `[ ]` Not started
