**Task: World HUD / Dashboard Layout Designer (Multi‑Phase)**

**Context**
- Game2D already uses `WorldToolPlugin` + `WorldToolsPanel` to show tools (Relationships, Quest Log, Inventory, World Info, Mood Debug, etc.).
- Initial placement lived as a single “cluster” controlled in `Game2D.tsx`.
- Designers should be able to shape the HUD (which tools, where, and how many) **per‑world** without touching code.

Below are 10 phases for evolving the HUD system over time.

> **For agents:** When you complete or extend a phase, update the checklist and add a short note (files/PR/date). Treat phases 1–5 as “shipped v1”; phases 6–10 are forward‑looking.

### Phase 1 – Minimal Per‑World HUD Config

**Goal**  
Introduce a per‑world HUD config that controls which tools are visible, without changing the overall layout.

**Scope**
- Add HUD config under `GameWorld.meta`.
- Filter `worldToolRegistry.getVisible(context)` based on this config.

**Key Steps**
1. Define HUD config types (now in `WorldUiConfig` in `@pixsim7/types`).
2. Add helpers in `@pixsim7/game-core/world/worldUiConfig.ts` to read/write `WorldUiConfig` from `GameWorldDetail.meta`.
3. In Game2D, after building `WorldToolContext`, compute `enabledToolIds` from config and filter `worldToolRegistry.getVisible(context)` before passing tools to the HUD layout.
4. Preserve default behavior when no HUD config is present (all tools enabled).

---

### Phase 2 – Regions & Basic Layout

**Goal**  
Allow placing tools into coarse regions (top/left/right/bottom/overlay) while keeping implementation simple.

**Scope**
- Extend HUD config with region + order.
- Introduce a layout helper and regional HUD component.

**Key Steps**
1. Define `HudRegion` and `HudToolPlacement` (see `frontend/src/lib/worldTools/types.ts`).
2. Add helpers that, given:
   - `visibleTools` from `worldToolRegistry.getVisible(context)`,
   - `hudPlacements` from config,
   return tools grouped and sorted by region.
3. Implement `RegionalHudLayout` to render separate `WorldToolsPanel` instances (or wrappers) for each region.
4. Fall back to the legacy “single cluster” when no placement info exists.

---

### Phase 3 – HUD Layout Editor

**Goal**  
Provide an in‑app editor so designers can choose which tools appear and in which region, per world.

**Scope**
- Editor manipulates `HudToolPlacement` data and persists to world meta.

**Key Steps**
1. Implement `frontend/src/components/game/HudLayoutEditor.tsx`:
   - Props: `worldDetail`, `onSave`, `onClose`.
   - Reads HUD configuration from `worldDetail.meta`.
   - Lists `worldToolRegistry.getAll()` as available tools.
   - Lets designers:
     - Choose region (`top/bottom/left/right/overlay/hidden`).
     - Set order (`order` field).
2. Wire the editor into Game2D HUD customization (e.g. HUD customization button/panel).
3. Confirm worlds without HUD data continue to work with sensible defaults.

---

### Phase 4 – Visibility Conditions (View Mode / Capability / Flags)

**Goal**  
Allow simple conditions on HUD placements based on view mode, capabilities, time, flags, etc., without building a full rule engine.

**Scope**
- Optional visibility conditions on placements.
- Small evaluation helper.

**Key Steps**
1. Extend `HudToolPlacement` with a `visibleWhen` object (already present) that can represent:
   - View‑mode gating.
   - Capability presence.
   - Session flags, location, time slots, quest states, relationships.
2. Add a helper that filters placements by:
   - Current `viewMode` (`WorldUiConfig.viewMode`).
   - Current capabilities (from the capability registry).
   - Current world/session state (flags, time, location).
3. Extend `HudLayoutEditor` so designers can choose a `visibleWhen.kind` and configure basic parameters (e.g. flag id, capability id).

---

### Phase 5 – Local HUD Presets

**Goal**  
Make it easy to reuse HUD layouts across worlds by introducing presets stored on the frontend.

**Scope**
- Presets are named collections of `HudToolPlacement`.
- Stored in localStorage; no backend requirement for v1.

**Key Steps**
1. Define `HudLayoutPreset` and a small preset store (see `frontend/src/lib/worldTools/hudPresets.ts`).
2. Extend `HudLayoutEditor` to:
   - “Save current layout as preset” (name + optional description).
   - “Apply preset” to overwrite the world’s HUD placements.
3. Keep everything opt‑in and local; avoid backend changes in this phase.

---

### Phase 6 – Player Profiles & View‑Mode‑Specific Layouts

**Goal**  
Allow different HUD layouts per player profile and/or view mode (e.g. cinematic vs hud‑heavy) using existing placements and presets.

**Scope**
- Layer “profile” on top of `WorldUiConfig` + presets.

**Key Steps**
1. Introduce a notion of HUD profile (e.g. `profileId`) stored in user preferences or session flags.
2. Extend HUD resolution to consider `(worldId, viewMode, profileId)` when selecting placements/presets.
3. In `HudLayoutEditor`, add a profile selector and allow editing layout per profile.
4. Provide a small toggle in Game2D to switch profiles and verify layout changes.

---

### Phase 7 – Shared / Server‑Backed HUD Presets

**Goal**  
Allow teams to share HUD presets across machines by syncing them to backend or `GameWorld.meta`, instead of only localStorage.

**Scope**
- Keep local presets; add optional world/global shared presets.

**Key Steps**
1. Define a serializable HUD preset shape suitable for `GameWorld.meta` or a dedicated endpoint.
2. Add helpers to merge local presets with world‑scoped presets.
3. Extend `HudLayoutEditor`:
   - Mark presets as local vs shared.
   - Provide actions like “publish to world” / “copy from world”.
4. If needed, define a minimal backend API for global presets under a `game_hud` namespace.

---

### Phase 8 – HUD Usage Analytics

**Goal**  
Help designers understand which HUD tools are actually used or opened during playtests, to inform layout decisions.

**Scope**
- Dev‑only usage metrics (local or lightweight backend aggregation).

**Key Steps**
1. Instrument world tool panels to record when they are opened/closed and how long they remain visible.
2. Store usage counts per `toolId` (and optionally per world) in localStorage or a dev‑only backend.
3. Add a “HUD Analytics” dev panel that:
   - Lists tools by usage frequency.
   - Shows distribution by region/view mode.
4. Optionally surface hints in `HudLayoutEditor` (e.g. low‑usage tools flagged subtly).

---

### Phase 9 – Layout Validation & Recommendations

**Goal**  
Automatically flag problematic HUD layouts (e.g. too many tools in one region) and suggest simple fixes.

**Scope**
- Static validation on placements and conditions.

**Key Steps**
1. Define validation rules (e.g. max tools per region, conflicting visibility conditions).
2. Add a validator that runs on the current layout and returns warnings + recommendations.
3. Show warnings inline in `HudLayoutEditor` (e.g. under the table or in a sidebar).
4. Provide “auto‑fix” options where safe (e.g. normalize order, move rarely used tools to overlay).

---

### Phase 10 – Responsive / Device‑Aware HUD Layouts

**Goal**  
Adapt HUD layouts for different display modes (desktop vs narrow/mobile) and resolutions without duplicating all placement data.

**Scope**
- Extend layout resolution to consider viewport size and device type.

**Key Steps**
1. Add optional responsive hints to placements (e.g. `hideOnNarrow`, `collapseToOverlay`).
2. Update `RegionalHudLayout` to read viewport metrics and apply responsive rules when rendering.
3. Ensure existing configs behave the same on desktop; treat responsive behavior as opt‑in.
4. Document responsive conventions in `docs/HUD_LAYOUT_PHASES_6-10_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`.
